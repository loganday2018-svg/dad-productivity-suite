# Dad Productivity Suite

A collection of tools to help with dashboards and PowerPoint generation at work.

## Project Structure

```
dad-productivity-suite/
├── specs/              # Codex-generated specifications and plans
├── src/               # Implementation code
│   ├── dashboard/     # Dashboard tools and visualizations
│   └── ppt-generator/ # PowerPoint generation utilities
├── reviews/           # Code reviews from Codex
└── README.md          # This file
```

## Workflow

1. **Planning**: Codex (via Cursor) creates specifications in `/specs`
2. **Implementation**: Claude Code executes specs and writes code in `/src`
3. **Review**: Codex reviews the implementation, feedback in `/reviews`

## Getting Started

More details coming soon as we build out the tools.
